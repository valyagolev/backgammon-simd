Type-safe valid move generator for backgammon using SIMD instructions. Useful for e.g. ML stuff.

Is it actually **very fast**? Probably not. Currently takes 7Âµs per board on my slow box (~140k/s). Let me know who to compete with. But it's nice to use and doesn't feel like a complete waste, performance-wise.

I only tested it using nightly, it wants `#![feature(portable_simd)]`.

Probably a lot of room for improvement ;-)
